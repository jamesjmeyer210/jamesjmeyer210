# Just Do It

This site has been online for over 2 years.
My intention upon its creation was that I would be regularly updating it with blog posts.
I have plenty of thoughts and discoveries that belong on the internet.
So what held me up?
Why did it take me over 2 years to start writing this first blog post?
Was it a lack of knowledge? 
Was it a lack of ambition?

The simple truth is, I spun in circles, paralyzed by over analysis.
*"I'll make this site like the  one I worked on for Bitcoin Tech Weekly"* - I originally thought to myself. I'll pull in a few
Javascript libraries and convert Markdown to HTML in the browser.
*"Maybe I should use this site as a platform to learn a Javascript framework.
But which one would I use? React? Angular?"* - I distracted myself.
*"I don't need React to write blogs! I just need to find a simple CSS framework."* - I realized.

How many times had I read through the sparse, Spectre CSS docs?
Then I realized: **I don't need any of this stuff**. 
I don't need a framework.
I don't need an over-engineered design.
I don't even need a CSS library.
I don't even need a navbar!
So that is what this site has become - an exercise of minimalism, inspired by a famous [website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) that brings nostalgia to all developers.

At the time of writing this post, this website uses a total of one CSS classes. Yes, this beautiful font class:
```css
.font-default {
    font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;
}
```

So what did I learn?
Just do it.
Of course, I'll improve the appearance of this site over time.
But now it's actually worth visiting.
And frankly, I'm much happier with this simple HTML/CSS only site than I would have been with anything else.
