This site has been online for over 2 years.
My intention upon its creation was that I would be regularly updating it with blog posts.
I have plenty of thoughts and discoveries that belong on the internet.
So what held me up?
Why did it take me over 2 years to start writing this first blog post?
Was it a lack of knowledge? 
Was it a lack of ambition?
