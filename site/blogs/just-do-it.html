                <em>"Paralysis by analysis! If it were up the engineers, a car would never leave the assembly line!" -
                Dan Pena, the Trillion Dollar Man</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                This site has been online for over 2 years. My intention upon its creation was that I would be regularly
                updating it with blog posts. I have plenty of thoughts and discoveries that belong on the internet. So
                what held me up? Why did it take me over 2 years to start writing this first blog post? Was it a lack of
                knowledge? Was it a lack of ambition?
            </p>
            <p>
                The simple truth is, I spun in circles, paralyzed by over analysis. <em>"I'll make this site like the
                one I worked on for Bitcoin Tech Weekly"</em> - I originally thought to myself. I'll pull in a few
                Javascript libraries and convert Markdown to HTML in the browser. <em>"Maybe I should use this site as
                a platform to learn a Javascript framework. But which one would I use? React? Angular?"</em> - I
                distracted myself. <em>"I don't need React to write blogs! I just need to find a simple CSS framework."</em>
                - I realized.
            </p>
            <p>
                How many times had I read through the sparse, Spectre CSS docs? Then I realized: <strong>I don't need
                any of this stuff</strong>. I don't need a framework. I don't need an over engineered design. I don't
                even need a CSS library. I don't even need a navbar! So that is what this site has become - an exercise
                of minimalism, inspired by a famous <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank">website</a>
                that brings nostalgia to all developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time of writing this post, this website uses a total of one CSS classes. Yes, this beautiful font
                class:
            </p>
            <pre><code><span style="color: #5036A0">.font-default</span> {
    font-family: <span style="color: #48A034">"Lucida Console"</span>, <span style="color: #48A034">"Courier New"</span>, monospace;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                So what did I learn? Just do it. Of course I'll improve the appearance of this site over time. But now
                it's actually worth visiting. And frankly, I'm much happier with this stupid simple HTML/CSS only site
                than I would have been with anything else.
